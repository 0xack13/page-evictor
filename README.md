## How long have I been on this page?

Based on Google's PageTimer, in addition to all features of Google PageTimer, PageEvictor can help in limiting the number of time allowed to each website/domain that can be specified in the settings e.g.

```
www.google.com,01:30
```

One the allowed time elapsed, the user will be redirected to the target tab and will be promoted continoiusly to close the tab.
